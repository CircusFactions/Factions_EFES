                A collection of currently known inscribed references to the Circus Factions in the eastern empire, beyond Constantinople, was first made in 1966 by 
                Α. Christophilopoulou; Alan Cameron then developed this in an Appendix to his 1976 study, <bibl><ptr target="cameron1976"/>Circus Factions</bibl>. An expanded list was presented in 
                2021 by Roueché for a publication in memory of Alan Cameron 
                (for all these see further <ref target="concordances/bibliography/">Bibliography/Concordance</ref>).
These publications were simple assemblies or lists of texts, without the opportunity to present them in context. The aim of this article is to explore 
the benefits of online publication for a presentation of this kind. The material can, of course, be presented in full, with detailed descriptions of each of the 80 texts 
identified. In most cases it allows for illustration of those texts. Perhaps more importantly, it supports the categorisation of the items in various ways, which may help us 
to greater understanding of their function and significance.
            </p>
            <p> Cameron presented the items 
              by geographical area: but this form of presentation - imposed by a list in analogue form - perhaps obscures other differentiating 
              features. For the <hi rend="b">geographic</hi> distribution see Index of <ref target="indices/epidoc/findspot.html">Findspots</ref>. 
              To some extent the distribution reflects the intensity of study in certain areas: 
              there is for example a great deal of material from the well-excavated sites of Aphrodisias and Ephesus, and 80 texts come from only 30 locations. 
              Of those, only 7 had hippodromes; but this simply demonstrated, as Cameron showed, that interest in the factions spread far beyond the hippodrome.</p> 
            
            <p>Out of 80 texts the majority (50) have been recorded in situ, from sites which were not overlaid by further development after the seventh century. 

The <hi rend="b">locations</hi> can therefore be examined: see <a target="_blank" href="search/">Search</a>, under Monument Type. Many of the locations (28) are in auditoria, 
              as might be expected, or in streets, stairways and colonnades (16), where they may reflect the involvement of the factions in public ceremonial activities. 
              But some are found in a domestic context - and four are associated with churches.</p>
            
            <p>The texts can be analysed by <hi rend="b">type</hi>: see <ref target="_blank" href="search/">Search</ref>, under Text Type. Three people are identified by their factional 
              loyalties in their epitaphs; there are also 11 place 
              inscriptions. But three-quarters - 60 - are acclamations, 
              49 of which are calls for victory, 
              Νικᾷ ἡ τύχη.  Of these 6 also include the fortune of the emperor(s)  
              (<ref type="inscription" n="Factions007">7</ref>, <ref type="inscription" n="Factions008">8</ref>, <ref type="inscription" n="Factions009">9</ref>, <ref type="inscription" n="Factions011">11</ref> 
                <ref type="inscription" n="Factions014">14</ref>, <ref type="inscription" n="Factions015">15</ref>), and two the fortune of the city (<ref type="inscription" n="Factions035">35</ref>, 
                <ref type="inscription" n="Factions055">55</ref>). Those seem clearly to have a public -
              ?official - function; 
              Some acclamations, however, are clearly private/domestic - for example on a comb (<ref type="inscription" n="Factions075">75</ref>), or a pithos (<ref type="inscription" n="Factions061">61</ref>,61). 
              </p>
            
            <p>The function of a text is sometimes indicated by its <hi rend="b">support</hi> 
              (see <a target="_blank" href="search/">Search</a>, under Support Object Type). 10 acclamations are on seating - 
              which might mark official or unofficial allocation; 6 other seats have place inscriptions. Several place inscriptions() are on columns; 
              this is not unusual for place inscriptions, although it is sometimes unclear exactly what space they are defining. Their meaning may of course vary, 
              and I have argued that in some cases an acclamation, or a place inscription, may indicate the location of a group at the time of a public event 
              (<ref target="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001007365">Roueché: 1999</ref>). The texts on a column at Oxyrhynchus (76) now unfortunately lost, may indicate this: the "place of the Blues" may 
              indicate where they stood on such an occasion, and the acclamation for Phocas may be what they then performed. It wold be dangerous to interpret this, 
              as some have done, as evidence of a special relationship between that emperor and that faction: 
              it is entirely possible that there was a place of the Greens on another column, with 
              a similar acclamation. To be acclaimed by both factions was a far greater expression of power and stability than to be aligned with only one; I 
              belive that we can see 
              a similar arrangement, balancing acclamations by the two major factions, on the "Gate of Hadrian" at Ephesus, <ref target="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001007365">Roueché (1999)</ref>, no.7.
            </p>
            <p>Another significant support is on the elements of a gateway. At Ephesus acclamations marked three official points of entry 
                (<ref type="inscription" n="Factions007">7</ref>, <ref type="inscription" n="Factions008">8</ref>, <ref type="inscription" n="Factions011">11</ref>) and another is on an elements 
              of an entrance now lost (<ref type="inscription" n="Factions013">13</ref>). Acclamations at Aphrodisias also mark a point of entry (33, 34); while these appear relatively formal, another (38) seems much less so. 
            Another group, from Syria, are all on lintel blocks, three apparently in domestic buildins (63, 64, 66) and one on an entrance into a church. These would seem to be 
            invocations of good fortune, in the tradition of the épigraphie des linteaux characteristic of the area *see further Roueché 2021)</p>
            
            <p><hi rend="b">Execution</hi>?
            Traditional scholarship for many years saw such texts as insignificant, both because of their apparently frivolous content, and also because of their script; they were often classified as miscellaneous, 
            or with the rather unclear designation of graffiti, applied both to content and to form. We have a better understanding now of the role of acclamations, and 
            the study of late antique epigraphy has helped us appreciate styles of inscription that may have seemed inferior or casual. 
            Some texts are clearly the work of a mason with a chisel, even if the alignment is inelegant 
            a striking example is the acclamations for Albinus at Aphrodisias, <ref target="https://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/insaph/iaph2007/iAph040021.html">IAph2007 4.21</ref>. The manner of inscribing is 
            clearly important: see <a target="_blank" href="search/">Search</a>, under Execution. 
            But whether an inscription can be understood as public/official or private/unofficial remains difficult in many cases.  It may be that we need 
            further descriptive categories for defining various forms of non-standard execution; but the interpretation of some texts and their function 
            remains difficult. A good example is provided by 35, a group of acclamations for the two factions and the city. The content therfore suggests a 
            relatively formal function. The location is challenging, because they are cut on the face of three adjacent column nbases, so relatively close to the ground; and the 
            execution is in complex and elegant letters, but very lightly cut with a thin point. Their status and function must therefore remain uncertain.</p>
